We run two internal employee security training courses at ZappiStore; one [for everyone](/for_everyone/) covering a variety of general security topics relevant to all employees, and one [for build](/for_build/) covering more technical security concepts relevant to those in our build function. This site provides all of the public material for both of these courses.
